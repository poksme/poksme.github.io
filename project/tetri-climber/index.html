<h2 id="gameplay">GamePlay</h2>
<p><img class="float-right" alt="The game is shown playing at speed 8x" src="/assets/accelerated-gameplay.gif">
The gameplay is based on Tetris with one simple addition: <em>Climby</em>. This round character is moving on the board and the goal is to take him as high as possible using tetrominoes. <em>Climby</em> movements are highly predictable, he follows 6 simple rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Climby</em> never stops rolling</li>
<li>If <em>Climby</em> comes across the border of the board he turns around</li>
<li>If <em>Climby</em> comes across a one block deep hole he falls</li>
<li>If <em>Climby</em> comes across a hole deeper than one block he turns around</li>
<li>If <em>Climby</em> comes across an obstacle taller than one block he turns around</li>
<li>If <em>Climby</em> comes across a one block tall obstacle he climbs  </li>
</ul>
<p>The higher <em>Climby</em> climbs, the higher your score will be on the leaderboard.</p>
<p>The player is controlling the tetrominoes falling from the top of the board using touch gestures similar to <a href="http://www.ea.com/tetris">EA&#39;s Tetris</a> on mobile phone. <em>Climby</em>&#39;s rolling speed depends on the board height (the higher the faster) and also on the left &amp; right directional buttons which appear on both sides of the board.</p>
<h2 id="two-players">Two Players</h2>
<p><img class="float-left" alt="An animation showing two players compete" src="/assets/two-players.gif">
TetriClimber being developed for <a href="/assets/samsung-pixelsense.jpg">Microsoft&#39;s PixelSense</a> (formerly Surface) the player has plenty of room on the screen. There is so much space that we could fit two boards. This way, two players can compete side by side. This layout was inspired by both <a href="/assets/cocktail.jpg">cocktail cabinet</a> and <a href="/assets/astrocity.jpg">2 players cabinet</a>.</p>
<p>Two player mode is a score race. But in order to spice up the gameplay we have put only one pair of directional buttons. The left player can only use the left button and the right player can only use the right button. This means that you can mess with your opponent timing but be aware that both buttons control both climby.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a double-edged sword!</p>
<h2 id="object-recognition">Object Recognition</h2>
<p><img class="float-right" alt="An animation showing the object recognition feature" src="/assets/object-recognition.gif">
Microsoft&#39;s PixelSense has built-in infrared sensors which can recognize object shapes and hand parts. We decided to use this feature to break the wall between the player and the game.</p>
<p>The player will be able to use physical tetrominoes made of cardboard that will be recognized by the game when laid on the screen. The next tetromino to fall in the game will match the printed shape. This is a powerful feature that can only be used once for each shape.   </p>
