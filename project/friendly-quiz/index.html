<h2 id="trivia-quiz">Trivia Quiz</h2>
<p><img class="float-right" alt="The game is shown playing at speed 8x" src="/assets/friendly-quiz-top.png"></p>
<p>Friendly Quiz is a cross platform (iOS, Android &amp; Windows Phone) Real Time Trivia Quiz application. Join a real time quiz where the fastest will score the most.</p>
<p>FriendlyQuiz is aimed at a large public, there is a lot different questions and categories. Challenge other players in one of the four default categories (movie, sports, music &amp; video games).</p>
<p>Players can compete to put their name in the leader board, unlock the best titles or just improve their knowledge.</p>
<p>The application contains unlockable content with in-app money such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avatars</li>
<li>Titles</li>
<li>Quiz sets</li>
</ul>
<p>This money can be collected at the end of each quiz set if the player ranks as one of the 3 best players.</p>
<h2 id="technologies">Technologies</h2>
<p>As a large team (8 students) we had to divide the work and choose the technologies early. We decided to divide the work as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>iOS - 2 students</li>
<li>Android - 2 students</li>
<li>Windows Phone - 2 students</li>
<li>Server - 2 students</li>
</ul>
<p>The next step was to design the architecture (pictured below). One critical point was to reduce the in-game latency while being able to scale. That is the reason why we decided to build two different servers, one in-game NodeJS server using TCP sockets and one general purpose server (website hosting, API) running Python.</p>

<h2 id="reception">Reception</h2>
<p><img class="float-left" alt="The game is shown playing at speed 8x" src="/assets/players.gif"></p>
<p>Part of our mission with Friendly Quiz was to gather as much players as possible. With the help of Microsoft&#39;s accelerator program and various publications on blogs (Presse Citron, LiveTile, WindowsGeneration) we could gather our first players.</p>
<p>Another way of getting new players to join FriendlyQuiz was to showcase the application at forums such as <em>App days</em> or <em>EIP Forum</em>. From there, word to mouth would bring more and more players.</p>
<p>Last but not least, one innovative way of getting people to know about Friendly Quiz was to create <a href="https://twitter.com/FqRobbie">a Twitter bot</a> that fetches the same questions the application uses. This way, twitter users could have a taste of Friendly Quiz without installing the application.</p>
<p>We were overwhelmed by the public reception with a total of 4000 registered players.</p>
